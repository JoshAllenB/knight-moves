# Knight's Move Solver

This project implements a solution for finding the shortest path for a knight's move on a chessboard using breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The program takes a starting square and an ending square as input and outputs the shortest path between them.

## Features

- Finds the shortest path for a knight's move on a chessboard.
- Handles out-of-bounds moves and ensures the knight stays within the board.
- Outputs the full path from the starting square to the ending square.
